          <h2>Artwork 1</h2>
          <p>ROAD NOT TAKEN : This painting, inspired by the theme "The Roads Not Taken," serves as a powerful commentary on the critical choices society faces and their consequences. At the center stands the Indian depiction of Lady Justice, symbolizing fairness and morality. Her scales and sword reflect the delicate balance between right and wrong and the power to enforce justice. The painting contrasts two distinct paths: the dystopian left and the structured right. On the left, chaos and despair prevail—a fiery backdrop highlights destruction, while a doctor, a nod to the R.G. Kar incident, represents the struggles of frontline workers. The depressed figure and the poor man symbolize societal neglect, mental health crises, and poverty. Above them looms the Orwellian eye, a stark reminder of surveillance, authoritarianism, and the loss of freedom in a world without justice.

In contrast, the right side appears orderly but reveals systemic bias. A powerful figure, likely a politician or wealthy individual, walks toward the light, representing privilege and societal favoritism. Police officers bowing to this figure critique the misuse of authority, while the Supreme Court, symbolizing justice, questions accessibility and equality in legal systems. The glowing light symbolizes hope, but its proximity to privilege raises concerns about fairness. The painting's duality emphasizes the consequences of societal choices—one leading to despair and inequality, the other to progress, albeit flawed. It calls for a commitment to justice as the guiding principle, urging viewers to reflect on their actions and responsibilities. Ultimately, the painting reminds us that the "roads not taken" define whether society succumbs to dystopia or strives toward a fair and equitable future.</p>
